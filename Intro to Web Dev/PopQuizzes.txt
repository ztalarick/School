Quizes for intro to web

Authoritative server- Server that says it doesn't have the data needed
Recursive server- Stored in the cache memory and either has the data needed or knows where to find it.

Link Layer: Packet Creation
Interent Layer: Makes use of IP adresses
Transport Layer: ensures transmissions arrive in order
Application Layer: DNS, SST


Project starts slow, speeds up in the middle and slows again in the end.

uncertainty of price is higher at the end of a project

I. Difference between authoritaive vs recersive DNS System
	Authoritative - Gives a direct response either the system identifies the adress or is doesn't
	Recursive  - Gives a response even if it doesn't identify the adress, Stored in the cache memory 
and either has the data needed or knows where to find it.


II. Packet Layers:
	1. Link Layer		Packet Creation
	2. Internet		Makes use of IP adresses
	3. Transport		Ensures the transmission of packets arrives in order 
	4. Applications		DNS SSH
III. Understand how Waterfall works
	1. Requirment Analysis 
		-Define problem
		-Step - by Step solution
		-Constraints
		-Measuring of sucess
	2. System Design
	3. Implementation
	4. Testing
		-whitebox
		-blackbox
	5. Deployment
	6. Maintenence
	Life Cycle of Project
		-Slow start, quck middle, slow finish
		-Highest cost uncertainty is at the end (graph - prediction, 3 lines space grows larger at the end)
IV. Testing
	Type of Errors
		1. Logic
			-hardest
			error in logic of the code
		2. Runtime
			- error when the code is running
			- outofbounds, converting string to int with invalid input
		3. Syntax
			-easiest to fix
			-code doesn't compile
			-error in grammar of code, ie forgetting a ;

	Whitebox
		-Testing through following logic of code
	Blackbox
		-Testing only through results of program with no knowledge of internal code
	Levels of Testing
		1. Unit Test
			-test each unit individualy
		2. Integration
			-integrate all units together and test or add units together and test one at a time
		3. Acceptance testing
			-Alpha/beta
			-actual users test
V. HTML stuff
	1. Table
		-<table> = defines a table 
		-<tr> = defines a row 
		-<th> = header, default bold 
		-<td> = all other cells no default
		-rowspan/colspan changes number of rows/collums a cell spans
		-no borders by default define in <head> </head> by:
			<style>
				table
					{border = 1px; }
 			</style>
